## Pluck

Pluck is a plugin for Obsidian (https://obsidian.md) that lets you quickly insert the contents of a web page into a note. Pluck converts a page's HTML into Markdown, then pastes that Markdown at your cursor location.

Pluck currently adds one command to Obsidian `Insert contents from URL`. Selecting that command, entering a URL, and pressing `enter` begins the conversion process.

If you’re using Obsidian 0.12.5 or later, Pluck will use the built-in Turndown service to convert the page’s HTML to Markdown. If you’re on an earlier version, a bundled Turndown will be used.
