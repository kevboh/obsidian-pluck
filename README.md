## Pluck

**NOTE**: This plugin is under active development, and is not yet ready for use in vaults you care about.

Pluck is a plugin for Obsidian (https://obsidian.md) that lets you quickly insert the contents of a web page into a note. Pluck converts a page's HTML into Markdown, then pastes that Markdown at your cursor location.

Pluck currently adds one command to Obsidian `Insert contents from URL`. Selecting that command, entering a URL, and pressing `enter` begins the conversion process.
